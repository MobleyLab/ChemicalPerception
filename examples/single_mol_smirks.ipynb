    "# Converting Molecules to SMIRKS Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall goal of `chemper` is to create hierarchical SMIRKS patterns that would maintain the clustering of input molecular subgraphs. \n",
    "`SMIRKS` patterns are a language for substructure searches that use decorators on the atoms and bonds in order to specify the desired chemistry (more details on this language are available in the [Daylight Theory Manual](http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.smarts.html)). \n",
    "The first step in understanding how to convert molecular subgraphs into SMIRKS patterns was to extract all possible decorators on atoms and bonds from a molecule object. \n",
    "Therefore to begin we created the `ChemPerGraph` which stores all possible decorators for atoms and bonds in a graph structure which can be written out as a SMIRKS pattern. \n",
    "\n",
    "These objects were created largely as a precursor to `ClusterGraph` which allows for multiple molecules to be converted into a single graph object. \n",
    "However, it is possible some people will find them useful for their standalone functionality.\n",
    "To the best of our knowledge, there was not previously a tool to create a SMIRKS pattern from a molecule to describe a fraction or all of the atoms in its structure. \n",
    "`RDKit` has a way to write molecules as \"SMARTS\" but as far as we can tell it just writes a SMILES string with square brackets around the atoms without any additional decorators used in `SMARTS` or `SMIRKS` and does not include support for atom indexing. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ChemPerGraph`'s can be built from a molecule and dictionary of key atoms using the `ChemPerGraphFromMol` class.\n",
    "These classes depend on `chemper` molecules which are simply wrappers for common cheminformatics toolkits. \n",
    "Currently we support `RDKit` and `OpenEye` toolkits. "

    "However, if you have an `rdchem.Mol` or `oechem.OEMol` the same functionality can be used with a call to `mol_toolkit.Mol(m)` where `m` is a molecule from the toolkit you have installed."

    "## Only the indexed atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most simple case, a `SMIRKS` pattern is created for only the indexed atoms. \n",
    "A `SMIRKS` index is used to tag specific atoms with a colon followed by a possitive integer. \n",
    "For example in `'[#6AX4:1]-!@[#1:2]'`, atom 1 (`:1`) is a carbon atom (`#6`) that is aliphatic (`A`) and has four connecting bonds (`X4`) and atom 2 (`:2`) is a hydrogen atom (`#1`). \n",
    "In that case, the two atoms are connected by a non-ring (`!@`) single bond (`-`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`ChemPerGraphFromMol` objects are initiated with a chemper molecule and a dictionary storing atom indices by desired `SMIRKS` index. \n",
    "The dictionary should have a key for the desired `SMIRKS` index and the entry is the index for the atom in the molecule being assigned that `SMIKRS` index. \n",
    "For example if you provided the dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "smirks_dict = {1:0, 2:3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "the atom with index `0` in your molecule would be used to make the atom in the SMIRKS pattern with `:1`. \n",
    "Similarly atom `3` in your molecule would be used to make the `SMIRKS` atom with `:2`."
