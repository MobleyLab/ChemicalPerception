    "# Makes SMIRKS from Molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will showcase how `chemper` `ClusterGraph`s store SMIRKS decorators for a set of molecular subgraphs. \n",
    "Remember the ultimate goal here is to take clustered molecular subgraphs and create a set of SMIRKS patterns that would put those molecular subgraphs into the same groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your initial clusters had 4 types of carbon-carbon bonds (single, aromatic, double, and triple), you would expect the final SMIRKS patterns to reflect those four categories. Keeping in mind that sorting by just bond order is unlikely to be detailed enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step here is to store possible decorators for atoms and bonds in a given cluster. This notebook will attempt to walk through the code that currently exists and goals for how to move forward"
