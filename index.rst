Welcome to ChemPer's documentation!
===================================

ChemPer is a set of tools from the `Open Force Field Consortium <http://openforcefield.org>`_
focused on automating chemical perception for force field parameterization.
Currently, ChemPer provides modules for generating SMIRKS patterns from molecule objects and specified atoms.
The final product will be capable of clustering molecular fragments based on reference data and
then assigning SMIRKS patterns for each of those clusters.
