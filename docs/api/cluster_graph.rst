Cluster Graphs
==============

`ClusterGraph`s are an expansion of the initial `ChemPerGraph`.
They can store information about multiple atoms and bonds simultaneously.
This is a starting example for how to use ``chemper``'s `ClusterGraph` class
to create SMIRKS patterns from clusters of molecular graphs.
